IFS = Has multiple conditions : Instead of true/false it has multiple conditions

IF example formula

=IF(D2:D10 > 30, "Old" , "Young")
>> Meaning if age is greater than 30 then = old and if false = young

IFS example formula

==IFS(F2:F10 = "Salesman","Sales", F2:F10 = "Receptionist","Hardworker",F2:F10 = "HR","Ask to improve")
>> Meaning if from cell F2 TO cell F10 there is sales add text of "sales", the condition repeats for the same cell with different job titles

*** LEN (length of number/ text)

=LEN(C2:C10)
>> meaning length of each text from cell C2 to C10

=LEFT(G2:G10,2)
>>Meaning starting from extreme left, in cell G2 to G10 extract 2 characters/ letters/ numbers

*** DATE TO TEXT
=TEXT(H2:H10,"dd/mm/yyyy")
>> Meaning text starting from cell H2 to H10 in the format "dd/mm/yyyy"

With 2 instances - =SUBSTITUTE(H2:H10,"/","-",2) > It changes both first and second / to -
