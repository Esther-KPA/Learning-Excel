To save file;
Ctrl + s - Save
Ctrl + z - Undo
Ctrl + t - Selecting table + Table formular (Helpful in keeping track of data




*** Drop-down menus (on top of table-header) :These are filters, e.g if you want to know how many people paid by cash, choose the drop-down menu in payment-mode column
then only select - Cash.
*** To sort - Use drop-down menu : Choose whether to start from low to high or vice-versa.
-- If you copy and paste data, sorting might not work, use =CLEAN(A1)*1 to the cells to remove
non-printable charaters.
-- After adding new values, you need to re-do the sorting otherwise its not considered.

*** To add more info/data to already existing data, go to the bottom and add text in first row, then
press "TAB" to move cell to right instead of down-wards
