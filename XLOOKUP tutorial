*** XLOOKUP
Essentially finds a value and returns it

=XLOOKUP(A3,H2:H10,P2:P10)
>> Formula, then from cell A3, look for matching name/digit in cell H2 TO H10 and return matching value/rmail/phonenumber/ date/ etc from cell P2 to P10

***   XLOOKUP MULTIPLE ROWS
Can add info in two separate rows/columns or more

=XLOOKUP(A3,I2:I10,O2:P10) 
>> The difference here is starting from O2 to P10

*** XLOOPUP Exact match

=XLOOKUP(A3,H2:H10,O2:O10,"Not found")
>> Look up email or name and if its not found, add string "Not found"

0 - Exact match - also default
-1 - exact match or next smaller item
1 - Exact match or next larger item
2 - Wildcard character match

=XLOOKUP("*"&A4,H2:H10,O2:O10,"Not found",2)
>> "*" Meaning anything before
    & + the character/value
    2 the wildcart character match
    
=XLOOKUP(A5&"*",H2:H11,O2:O11,"Not found",2)
>> Here it goes after the cell number

*** XLOOKUP Search order
=XLOOKUP(A3,N2:N10,I2:I10,,1)
>> Look up date from cell A3 in column N2 to N10 and return value from cell 12 to I10, 1 > exact match or next larger item


=XLOOKUP(A4,N3:N11,I3:I11,,,-1)
>> Same concept as before but changes with showing either from first to last or last to first (-1 is from last to first, 1 > first to last)

*** XLOOKUP Horizontal

=XLOOKUP(I1,H1:S1,H2:S2)
>> Look up I1 in the horizontal cell H1 to S1 and return matching value from horizontal cell H2 to S2

*** XLOOKUP SUM

=SUM(XLOOKUP(I1,H1:S1,H1:S2):XLOOKUP(J1,H1:S1,H2:S2))

*** VLOOK 

=VLOOKUP(A3,H2:P10,9,FALSE)
>> Meaning value in cell A3 find it from table H2 to P10, and return the match in 9th column, false- Exact match and true would be almost similar match
